## Advent of Code 2024

Before December I read [this news](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024) and that got me excited.
I started solving a problem every day without stopping until I failed a second part.
Reading other solutions for that part on Reddit I found unusual solutions...
They made me feel like I could do better by trying, for example, "functional JavaScript."
So I focused on that ugly code you'll take a look at â€”please, __never__ code like this.
I don't know how to describe these solutions (_compat_ maybe?) but I know I gained by doing this.
I learned a new way of thinking and now I like JS a bit more.

By the way, read this [book](https://www.crockford.com/image/howjsworks.pdf) if you don't love JavaScript.
